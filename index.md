# MOSAIC

Modular Open Source Analog Integrated Circuits

## Goals

1. Advance the state of the art in programmatic and automated IC design
2. Encourage community collaboration
3. Lower the barrier of entry
4. Improve designer productivity
5. Foster IP reuse
6. Support both open source and commercial toolsets

## Bootcamp

Silicon Austria Labs hosted a boot camp in August 2022 in Linz, Austria.  Participants from more than 10 institutions met to cooperate on open source analog IC design and programmatic design techniques.
